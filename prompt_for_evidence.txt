Given a 【Database schema】 description and the 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database knowledge, and then generate the 【Evidence】 of the 【Question】.
When generating 【Evidence】, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
1. Map the entities or metadata from user questions to the schema.
2. Take into account the examples in the schema and convert the natural language descriptions in user input into the standard format in the database.
3. Evidence should be a single sentence describing the relationship between user queries and the schema.

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch?
【Evidence】
The youngest client refers to the client with the most recent `birth_date` in the table client; the lowest average salary branch refers to the branch with the minimum `A11` value in the table district; gender is mapped to `gender` in the table client.
